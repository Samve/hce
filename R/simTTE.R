#' Simulate an `hce` dataset with two correlated outcomes (illness - death model)
#' 
#' Simulate an `hce` dataset with two correlated outcomes - death and hospitalization - from a heterogeneous population. The correlation between these outcomes arises from population heterogeneity. Models the risk of death following hospitalization as dependent on the timing 
#' of the hospitalization, reflecting strong dependence between the times to the first and second events (i.e., event clustering).
#'
#' @param n sample size in the active treatment group.
#' @param n0 sample size in the placebo treatment group.
#' @param TTE_A event rates in the active group for the time-to-event outcomes; a numeric vector of length two.
#' @param TTE_P event rates in the placebo group for the time-to-event outcomes; a numeric vector of length two.
#' @param shape shape parameter of the Weibull distribution for time-to-event outcomes in the active group. Default is 1 (exponential distribution).
#' @param shape0 shape parameter of the Weibull distribution for time-to-event outcomes in the placebo group. Default is 1 (exponential distribution).
#' @param fixedfy length of follow-up.
#' @param theta heterogeneity coefficient for the first event, modeled via a gamma distribution with mean 1; `theta` controls the variance. When `theta = 0`, there is no heterogeneity, which implies that death and hospitalization are independent.
#' @param alpha exponential heterogeneity coefficient for modeling the heterogeneity of risk of death after hospitalization; the heterogeneity of the second event is the inverse of the time of the first event.
#' @param rHR recurrence hazard ratio comparing the active group to the control group for the second event, based on gap time measured from the first event.
#' @details
#' The default setting assumes `TTE_A = TTE_P`. Both `TTE_A` and `TTE_P` must be numeric vectors of length two, corresponding to the event rates 
#' (Weibull distribution) for the first event of hospitalization and death. The parameters `shape` and `shape0` identify the shape parameters 
#' of Weibull distributions for the first event, simulated from a distribution with a cumulative hazard of `rate × gamma × t^shape` for 
#' hospitalization and `gamma^alpha × rate × t^shape` for death, where `gamma` is a patient-specific frailty drawn from a gamma distribution with mean 1 and 
#' variance `theta`, shared between death and hospitalization for a given patient. The parameter `theta` represents population heterogeneity and also induces 
#' correlation between death and hospitalization as competing first events. The parameter `alpha` controls the heterogeneity of time to death through its 
#' effect on heterogeneity. Death after hospitalization is simulated from an exponential distribution with a constant hazard that depends on the timing `t1` 
#' of the first event (hospitalization) as `(average provided first-event rate) × (t1 × gamma / fixedfy)^alpha` for the placebo arm and `(average provided first-event rate) × rHR × (t1 × gamma / fixedfy)^alpha` for the active arm where `rHR` is the recurrence
#' hazard ratio. When `alpha < 0`, earlier hospitalization (smaller `t1`) 
#' increases the risk of death following hospitalization.
